#  Defence System

This is an interactive web-based project that provides an overview of the **Indian Defence System**, highlighting the three main branches: **Indian Army, Indian Navy, and Indian Airforce**. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually engaging and informative layout.

## Features
- Displays information about the **Indian Army, Navy, and Airforce**.
- Uses **CSS styling** to differentiate each branch with unique colors.
- Implements **JavaScript** to dynamically adjust the **z-index**, allowing sections to come to the front on hover.

## How It Works
1. Hover over any of the three divisions (**Army, Navy, Airforce**).
2. The section will move to the top using **JavaScript z-index manipulation**.
3. Each section provides a brief description of its respective military branch.

## Technologies Used
